    "description": "Yes! By combining the right tools, processes, and planning itâ€™s the way that we now prefer to run sprints."

    "title": "Do I need any special materials?",
    "description": "Nope, not really! At most, all you'll need is some paper and your most favorite writing utensil for some of the activities like Speedy Eights or Story Boarding. These activities can also be done online, however, so not having these materials will not be detrimental to a successful Sprint."

    "title": "Do I need to learn any fancy design software?",
    "description": "Nope! We'll guide you through the activities and how best to use the platform so you can just focus on getting the most out of your Sprint experience. If you'd like to get familiar with some of the software we like to  use for Sprints, we're big fans of Miro and Figma."
