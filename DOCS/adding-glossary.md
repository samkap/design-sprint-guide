# Adding a New Glossary Term

1. Add a new markdown file inside `glossary`, for example: `cat.md`
2. Add your content, for example:

```markdown
---
title: Cat
---

# {{ title }}

A cat is a (usually) small furry creature that knocks things off shelves.
```

## Tips

- The glossary is a list of terms that people who aren't a designer, or developer, or have never taken part in a sprint may not know.
- Try to define the term as succinctly as you can.
