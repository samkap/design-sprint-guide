A wireframe is an outline of a website or app -- think its skeleton. A wireframe provides the architecture, layout, and functionality of a product in its early stage and is used primarily for testing with users. Usually, wireframes refrain from styling the product too much and focuses more on verifying the overall flow and experience of the product matches the user's expectations.
