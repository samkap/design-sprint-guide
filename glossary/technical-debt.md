title: Technical Debt
---

# {{ title }}
In its classical formulation, technical debt is described as intentionally taking shortcuts and cutting corners in code quality in order to speed up development. While this can be valuable in the short term, over the long term it makes the overall codebase more bug-prone and future features slower to develop. Eventually you “pay back” the debt by cleaning up the original code.
