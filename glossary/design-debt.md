# {{ title }}
Design debt is the lesser-known cousin of tech debt. Design debt represents the full spectrum of design work that has been banished to the dusty backlog. It includes everything from lack of design thinking processes to specific UI bugs that need fixing. It's what happens when the gap between your first feature and your 50th is so wide that you've given up on creating new things in the context of what's already happening in your product.
