## Introduction

During Converge our goal is to take all of the possibilities that we have
exposed over the past two days and hone in on a single version of the prototype
that we will build in the next phase.

Throughout Converge, the team should be thinking about the bigger assumptions
that are the most important to test. This should lead to a discussion about
what type of prototype will do the best job of validating or invalidating it.
Activities such as Assumption / Test Table and Final Storyboard should help the
team engage this conversation.
