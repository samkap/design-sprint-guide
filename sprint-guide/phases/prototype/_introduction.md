## Introduction

The core purpose of the prototype, the assumptions you are trying to
validate/invalidate or the knowledge gaps you are trying to fill should have
all been discussed in Converge. During this phase you will build a quick and
dirty prototype. Since you have limited time to build the prototype it
should be as low-fi as you can get away with during Testing.

During this phase roles shift. Designers are typically the ones building the
prototype unless it is low-fi enough for everyone to contribute. Product Owners
should be in charge of getting realistic information, data and copy into the
prototype. It should be clear what everyoneâ€™s role is before the phase starts.
The team should check in with each other as much as possible to make sure
everything is on the right track.
