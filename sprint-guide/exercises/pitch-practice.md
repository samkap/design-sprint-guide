Practice Pitching is simply reiterating why we are doing this sprint, the
problem we are trying to solve and the outcomes we hope to achieve. It’s a good
idea to practice the pitch several times throughout the sprint, typically at
the beginning of each day.

## Requirements
- **Estimated time needed**: 5 - 10 minutes
- **Team**: Facilitator, Note-taker, Stakeholders

## When should we do this exercise?

It’s best to practice the pitch several times throughout the sprint, typically
at the beginning of each day. It makes sure that everyone is staying in line
with the original intent of the sprint encapsulated in the Problems Statement.
It also allows the Product Owner to practice and refine the application’s
elevator pitch.

## Why should we do this exercise?

It can be easy to get distracted or lost focusing on an aspect of the problem
that is not really relevant to the overall problem. This exercise makes sure
that everyone is staying in line with the original intent of the sprint
encapsulated in the Problems Statement. It also allows the Product Owner to
practice and refine the application’s elevator pitch.

## Instructions

The Product Owner should walk the sprint team through:

- What is the Problem Statement / Jobs-to-be-done?
- What is the business opportunity?
- What is the market?

## Tips

- Try to do this every morning of each sprint Day. It is a great way for the team to refocus.
- If you have time, try to pitch again after lunch breaks, especially on sketching days.
