In speed critique the team will get a chance to discuss and summarise the [Heat Map](/exercises/heat-map),
making notes of the biggest ideas. The conversation
will have both a structure and a time limit.

## Requirements

- **Estimated time needed**: 3-5 minutes per sketch
- **Team**: Facilitator, Note-taker, Stakeholders

## Why should we do this exercise?

By the end of this exercise we will end up with a summary of the strongest
ideas produced so far. These ideas will later be voted upon to further wittle
them down.

## Instructions

For each sketch:

1. Set a timer for 3-5 minutes (you may find that you get faster towards the end).
2. The facilitator starts narrating the sketch, describing what is going on.
3. The facilitator calls out standout ideas that have lots of votes from the [Heat Map](/exercises/heat-map).
4. The team calls out any ideas that the facilitator missed.
5. The ideas get written down by the note-taker.
6. Review the questions/concerns.
7. The creator points out any missed ideas, and answers any questions.
8. Repeat for the next sketch.

## Tips

- Swap out the narrator role so that the facilitator doesn't get too tired.
