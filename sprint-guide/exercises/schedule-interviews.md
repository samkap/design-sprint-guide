title: Schedule 4–6 people for testing interviews
---

During the [Test phase](/phases/test), we'll be running user interviews and
showing the prototype to 4–6 people.

If users are already identified, we should set up the interviews as early as
possible. If users aren't identified yet, we should hold off till after
Understand phase.
