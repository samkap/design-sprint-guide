A lot of ideas will be generated throughout the week. Some of the ideas will be
pertinent to the tasks at hand, but others, although interesting, wonâ€™t be.
Capture these good but not immediately relevant back burner ideas on a sticky
note board.

## Instructions

- Create a dedicated area to write down assumptions during the sprint.
- Throughout the sprint have everyone write down ideas that don't solve the
  right problem, right now, but might be useful in future.

## Tips

- As a team during the converge phase, review all the ideas that have been put up on the wall. 
  - Trash any that aren't relevant anymore.
  - Record all ideas in a separate document or Trello.
