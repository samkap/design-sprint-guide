title: Sprint Questions
---

To support our [Problem Statement](/exercises/problem-statement) what questions
do we need to answer? What would we have to do to fail in that goal?

## Requirements

- **Estimated time needed**: 30 minutes
- **Team**: Facilitator, Note-taker, Stakeholders

## Why should we do this exercise?

We should already have a very short [Problem Statement](/exercises/problem-statement),
when we write that we were dreaming big, and not letting the every-day
realities get in the way now it's time to dig into that problem a bit more and
write some questions that this sprint needs to answer.

## Instructions

1. Create a space to list your questions.
2. Offer the following prompts to the team:
  - What questions so we want to answer in the is sprint?
  - To solve our problem statement what needs to true?
  - If in future this project completely failed, what might have cuased that?
3. Rephrase the answers into questions, for example:

> Q: To get more customers what has to be true?

> A: They have to trust us.

> Q: How can we phrase that as a question?

> A: Will potential customers trust our skills?

## Tips

- This exercise may seem negative, but it's a good think to think aboout potential failures and avoid it happening from the beginning.
- You may not come up with many questions straight away, that's OK, try to add to the list throughout the rest of the sprint.
- Use your sprint questions as a guide when creating ideas.
- Use your sprint questions when you're writing you testing script.
