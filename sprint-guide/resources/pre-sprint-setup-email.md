Hi _________,

We're excited to start your design sprint!

To prepare for it, it would be great to have:

(1) a list of competitors' and peers' websites similar to parts of what we want to create, as well as other resources with aspects we may wish to emulate.

(2) information about each of your key customer types: who they are, their stories, and how they feel about the problem we are working to solve. If there's documentation from interviews you conducted with them, we'd love to see that too.

(3) Any existing materials you already have on hand, such as user stories, wireframes, or prototypes. No need to flesh these out more than you already have, but they'd be great background. Note that what we end up with at the end of the sprint may be different.

(4) Any other background materials you already have.

(5) We'll start each day at {time} and end at approximately {time}. This gives our team time to debrief and prep for the next day's session. We will send a more detailed agenda for each session soon.

(6) For {date}, we'll want to schedule time with users in the morning and early afternoon. Six users for {minutes/hour} each would be ideal. If you identify the people you want to bring in, we'd be happy to schedule them, or you could schedule the times directly if that's easier. We'll have each participant use the prototype we built and ask them questions to get their feedback.

Please also review the [Design Sprint Guide], as well as [Google Ventures' resources about the process][GV].

See you soon. Thanks,
