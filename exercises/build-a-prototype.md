title: Build a Prototype
---

The core purpose of the prototype, the assumptions you are trying to
validate/invalidate or the knowledge gaps you are trying to fill should have
all been discussed in [Converge](/phases/converge).

During this phase roles shift. Designers are typically the ones building the
prototype unless it is low-fi enough for everyone to contribute. The rest of
the team should be in charge of getting realistic information, data and copy
into the prototype. It should be clear what everyone's role is before the phase
starts. The team should check in with each other as much as possible to make
sure everything is on the right track.

## Tools & Methods

There are lots of different tools out there to build a prototype with. Picking
the right tools depends on the goal of the sprint, how many solutions you want
to test, and how the real tool will work. For example anything that is going to
be used primarily on a smartphoen should be prototyped on a smartphone, if your
product is going to be a service a script and a prototype paper form could be
enough.

### High-fidelity
- Figma: A great all-in-one power tool to create and share prototypes with users.
- Webflow: You can create realistic websites quickly with Webflow
- HTML/CSS: Sometimes that key interaction simply cannot be faked so HTML/CSS (and a bit of JS) is a good choice.

### Low-fidelity
- Miro: There are lots of easy to use UI kits for Miro, this is a great way to involve everyone.
- Keynote/Powerpoint: These tools are familiar to lots of people and can be used to quickly create a prototype.
- Paper: When testing in person paper can be surprisingly effective.

At thoughtbot we primarily build our prototypes in Figma or Miro.

When building any prototype it's important to remember to balance time and
realism. The prototype needs to be realistic enought to understand, but not
take too long to build. An unrealistic prototype will distract potential users,
and taking too long risks wasting the teams time if the solution is not well
received. It's a principle that [Jake Knapp](https://www.thesprintbook.com)
calls 'the goldilocks quality'.

## Tips

- When working with digital tools start with text, it's much easier to get a
  good foundation and slowly build up the fidelity from there.
- Use scenarios if you're testing more than one functionality. It can be tricky
  to come up with realistic reasons to test some features so skip ahead.
