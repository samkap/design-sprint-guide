title: Sticky Feedback

Using a digital whiteboard to gather qualitative data in a fast and easy way.

## Why should we do this exercise?

Throughout the interviews you will be constantly capturing hearing useful insights, it's easy to lose that valuable information if you don't have a good way to keep it. Gathering that feedback in a visual way against the interface of the prototype is helpful for comparing notes, and the color-coding helps form heat maps of feedback.

## Instructions

In a digital whiteboard:

- Upload images of every screen in the prototype.
- Assign each tester a color of sticky note, and a color for ideas and questions.
- During the interviews as the team to write down anything you think was important.
    - Capture exact words but paraphrasing is okay.
    - Capture exact quotes from users when possible.
    - Capture significant non-verbal reactions, like a very long pause before an answer.
    - If you have a feature idea, question or insight beyond what the participant said, mark
      it in your notes as such.

Consider combining this approach with a [Scorecard](/exercises/scorecard).
