A good first step to coming up with ideas is to gather all the information
about the problem you want to solve into one place, and make notes in your own
words.

## Requirements

- **Estimated time needed**: 7 minutes
- **Team**: Facilitator, Note-taker, Stakeholders

## Why should we do this exercise?

So far we have created a lot of resources and infromation to refer to. Now it's
time to focus on a small area of our problem so that we can draw a solution
later. Mind mapping is a handy way to take stock of all the resources that are
relevant to this part of the problem, then we can start getting creative with a
little more focus.

## Instructions

You (and everyone in the group) needs to get some drawing tools and sheets of
paper. Each team member then writes down everything that's on their mind
regarding the chosen part of the [Map](/exercises/make-a-map). Don't stop
writing. Look at the most voted [HMWs](/exercises/hmw), the [Lightning demos](/exercises/lightning-demos),
as well as the other resources you've created so far - these should all give
you inspiration or an area to explore. These notes are just for you, they won't
be shared with the group.

## Tips

- Copy down the problem statement onto the page first.
- Don't worry too much about generating ideas at this stage, there's time for that later.
- With a minute to go circle the most interesting things that you've just noted down.
