By now you should have the beginnings of a few ways to solve this problem, this
is a chance to start exploring those ideas without a specific focus.

## Requirements

- **Estimated time needed**: 7 minutes
- **Team**: Facilitator, Note-taker, Stakeholders

## Why should we do this exercise?

This is the first chance that everyone will have had to sketch out an idea that
they may already have. Something that get jotted down in this session could
become a great idea later on.

## Instructions

Now it is time to get visual. Look at the problem area or solution you have
been [mind mapped](/exercises/mind-mapping) about. This time try not to write
anything about it but doodle interesting ideas or solutions instead. Ugly is
OK, no one will see this!

## Tips

- With a minute to go circle the most interesting things that you've just drawn.
