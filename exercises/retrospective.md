title: Sprint Retrospective
---

At the end of the sprint we'll talk about how everything went. Each person will
talk about wins we had as a team, how we feel on the sprint, and what concerns
they have. We'll then talk about the concerns as a group and discuss action
items to resolve those concerns.

We encourage transparency in these meetings to discuss the sprint with honesty
with the team. The whole team should be involved in the discussion and sharing
when prompted. All notes should be captured and shared.

### Agenda

#### What went well?

Celebrate success. Review the work that done, and congratulate those who made it happen.

Ask each person — either anonymously or publicly — to share what they feel has
gone well during the sprint. Make a note of each item. Ask them to elaborate if
needed.

#### What needs improvement?

Ask each person — either anonymously or publicly — to share what they feel
hasn't gone so well during the sprint. Make a note of each item. Ask them to
elaborate if needed.

#### Action items

Ask the team: "Based on everything discussed what actions can we take to improve things?"

Note down ideas, and discuss which we will move forwards with. It's also
important to assign those tasks to a person, preferably with a deadline.
