title: Review Roles

Before the sprint starts decide who is going to take on the key roles during
the sprint.

## Why should we do this exercise?

There are some important roles to be played during a sprint, not clearly
defining who these people are could lead to discussions de-railing, desicions
descending into long conversations, and failing to record an important detail.

## Instructions

Take some time to assign the following roles:

**Facilitator**

Leads the design sprint. The facilitator makes sure that the rest of the team
understand the exercises and keeps to the schedule. The facilitator can answer
questions that the team have.

**Note-taker**

Takes notes. The note-taker is in charge of the documentation for the sprint.
They may also be asked to help setup timers, and collect votes, and oterhwise
keep things organised so that the facilitator is free to lead the sprint.

**Decider**

Typically the client and the person with the initial product vision. This
person has final say on any tough decisions. They usually have the broadest
understanding of the problem to be solved

Once you have decided who these people will be send a message to the team to
list the roles and who has been assigned them. If the team are not familiar
with the people use this as an oppurtunity to informally introduce them before
you all meet up.
