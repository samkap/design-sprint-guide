title: Group Critique
---

An in-depth, less structured discussion and critique of ideas in sketches or
storyboards.

If you find your group needs more structure, [Speed Crit](./speed-crit.md) may
be a better fit.

## Requirements

- **Estimated time needed**: 3 minutes per sketch
- **Team**: Facilitator, Note-taker, Stakeholders

## Why should we do this exercise?

It is best to do a Group Critique after a [Heat Map](./heat-map) has already
been done. It allows for in-depth discussion around the ideas. It gives time for
people to say what they thought was good about the idea and for the person that
had the idea to add any more detail to the thought.

## Instructions

1. Everyone gathers around a sketch or [Story Board](./3-step-storyboards.md)
2. Ask people what they liked about it.
3. Ask the person that had the idea to add any more explanation that
   they think hasnâ€™t been covered or if something was misunderstood.
