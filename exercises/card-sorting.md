Throughout the day we we have collected lots of [How Might We](/exercises/how-might-we) questions, the
problem is they are probably in a big pile, and aren't organised at all. This
exercise will help us to make sense of the biggest questions we have raised so
far.

## Requirements

- **Estimated time needed**: 30 minutes
- **Team**: Facilitator, Note-taker, Stakeholders
- How Might We notes from ask the experts

## Why should we do this exercise?

By the end of this exercise we will have a list of the most useful, important, or risky questions that we hope to answer in the rest of sprint.

## Instructions

1. Ask the team to gather all of thier How Might We notes in a single place.
2. Set a timer for 10 minutes.
3. Ask the team to begin grouping all the notes into categories.
4. After 10 minutes add more time if the groups aren't looking well defined enough.
5. Once the groups are clearer start asking if any straggler questions could be added to larger groups.
6. Ask the group to give the groups titles.
7. Give 3 votes to each person, encourage them to take the time to read the HMWs, then vote for the ones that they feel are the most useful or important.
8. Gived the decider an additional 3 votes to add to the board.

## Tips

- Copy your most highly voted notes onto your [Critical Path](/exercises/critical-path) later. To make it easier to choose areas to focus on for the rest of the sprint.
